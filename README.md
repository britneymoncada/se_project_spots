**Intro**

Sick Spots Gallery allows travelers and explorers to showcase their favorite destinations by uploading a single photo for each location and adding a description. Each submission can contain:

Name of the contributor

Description of the spot

One photo with a caption of the location

Visitors can like photos they enjoy, helping highlight the most recommended places.

Before building the site, the layout and visual style were planned using Figma, allowing for a clear design blueprint before development began. This made it easier to ensure the site’s look, feel, and responsive behavior worked consistently across different devices.
